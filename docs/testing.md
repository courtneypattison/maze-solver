# Testing

## Stack Testing
For the stack ADT that I used in the maze solver, I went through each function and tested it in turn. The tests involved a comparison of the actual result of a function with the expected result, which I determined by hand.

## Maze Solver Testing
The maze solver was tested using mazes generated by a website. Essentially, I hard coded the filenames of these mazes into a main() that used the same functions as the main() for the program. When generating the mazes, I used different specifications, e.g., different sized hallways and mazes.
